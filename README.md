# Weather.AI - An Expo Mobile App

## Overview
Weather.AI is a mobile application developed using Expo and React Native, focusing on leveraging AI for accurate and real-time weather predictions. This app provides an intuitive interface for users to access weather forecasts, powered by advanced AI algorithms.

## Features
- Real-time weather forecasting.
- AI-driven analysis of weather patterns.
- User-friendly mobile interface.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get Weather.AI up and running on your local machine for development, testing, and possibly building the app for production.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (preferably the latest version)
- Expo CLI:
  ```sh
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:wahabkhan456/weather.ai.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd weather.ai-master
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or using Yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Running the App in Development Mode**:
   ```sh
   expo start
   ```
   This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Expo developer tools. You can then run the app on an iOS or Android simulator, or on your physical device by scanning the QR code.

## Usage

Describe how to use the app, including any specific configuration steps, if necessary. If your app requires setting up API keys or environment variables, provide guidance here.

## Building the App

Building a production-ready version of an Expo app involves bundling your JavaScript code, assets, and all other necessary components into a package that can be deployed on app stores or as a standalone app. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Building for iOS

1. **Set Up Your iOS Environment**: 
   - Ensure you have an Apple Developer account and Xcode installed if you plan to build the iOS app on your own machine.
   - Configure your `app.json` file with the appropriate [iOS fields](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#ios).

2. **Build the iOS App**:
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```sh
     expo build:ios
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure your Apple Developer credentials and choose your build type.

### Building for Android

1. **Set Up Your Android Environment**: 
   - Configure your `app.json` file with the appropriate [Android fields](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#android).

2. **Build the Android App**:
   - Run the following command in the terminal:
     ```sh
     expo build:android
     ```
   - Choose whether to build an APK (Android Package) or an Android App Bundle.

### Post-Build Steps

- After the build process completes, Expo provides a URL to download your app binaries (IPA for iOS, APK or AAB for Android).
- You can then upload these binaries to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, respectively.

### Additional Notes

- **EAS Build**: Expo also offers [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), a more configurable build service that requires an Expo subscription.
- **Customizing the Build**: Refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/building-standalone-apps/) for more detailed instructions and advanced configuration options.
